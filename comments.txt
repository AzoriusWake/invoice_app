Acceptance Criteria
1. User can click a button/link to create invoice.
* Code is pre-loaded in the file, and the user just needs to click the button to show the invoice form
2. User can specify customer name, date and invoice number.
* Fields at the top for customer name, date, and invoice number
3. User can add multiple line items by selecting products from a product search screen.
* On the right side, there is a list of products that a user can add to the invoice
4. Products/line items include Product Name, Quantity, Price, Total
* Fields with Product Name, Quantity, Price, and Total in the table
5. Line item fields for Quantity and Price are editable.
* Product Name, Quantity, and Price are editable
6. Clicks Save to save the invoice and line items.
* Save will package all the invoice information on the page, and has it ready to be sent off to the backend through an $http POST request. Upon successful save, the invoice will be emptied. Upon error, the invoice is returned.


Additional Questions
Keep in mind this is a very simple use case but think about it scaling to thousands of users and hundreds of line items on an invoice.
* Duplicates of line items on the same invoice requires additional memory so making sure they are all unique, and combine duplicates when found
* Sorting helps with large scale, so sorting line items alphabetically will help for future lookups
* Searching/filtering through invoices/line items should be added/optimized
* Adding pagination for queries, especially when invoices can return thousands of results
* Ensuring your models/databases are set up efficiently
* Add appropriate validations, and return incorrect invoice with error fields highlighted
As you think about the architecture consider what an enterprise user with their own business processes would need. How much configurability would you add? Think about usability as well.
* As each business is different, they may need additional fields to track
* Perhaps a notes section should be included to give flexibility in adding products
* Perhaps add specific groupings/bundles that may affect price (e.g., 20% discount when buying 3 or more, or 15% discount when buying product A and product B together)
* Other edits to pricing (% adjustments like employee discounts, tax)
How can you reduce clicks?
* File uploads that can parse a document (csv, excel, etc.) and automatically create an invoice/add inputs
* Copy/clone existing invoices in the database, make minor adjustments, and submit those (e.g., retrieve last month's invoice, clone it, change the dates, and submit for this month)
